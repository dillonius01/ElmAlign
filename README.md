# ElmAlign

### About:
The [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)] version of a simple Contacts/Companies app.
Built on top of the very handy [elm-webpack-starter](https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter) scaffolding.



### Install:
Install all dependencies using the handy `reinstall` script:
```
npm run reinstall
```
*This does a clean (re)install of all npm and elm packages, plus a global elm install.*

Or, if you already have elm installed globally, you can simply run

```
npm install
```


### Serve locally:
```
npm start
```
* Access app at `http://localhost:8080/`
* Get coding! The entry point file is `src/elm/Main.elm`
* Browser will refresh automatically on any file changes..


### Build & bundle for prod:
```
npm run build
```

* Files are saved into the `/dist` folder
* To check it, open `dist/index.html`
